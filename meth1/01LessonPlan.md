# Computer Science, Lesson Plan


**Grade: 5-6**


## Learning Objective:
Students will be able to identify, interpret, and write a block of Java code.

**NYS K-12 Computer Science & Digital Literacy Standards:**

*Abstract & Decomposition –
4-6.CT.4--* Decompose a problem into smaller named tasks, some of which can themselves be decomposed into smaller steps.

*Algorithms & Programming
4-6.CT.8*
-- Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.

**Materials:** 
Java text editing program

**Vocabulary:**
Java, Class, Methods, String, Primitive type, initialization, Concatenation 

**Motivation:**
On three separate pieces of paper, ask students to write down three questions in which the answer to the questions is a date. For example: 

*When is your birthday?* 

*What is your favorite day of the year? *


*What is the date of your favorite memory?* 


*What is your best friend’s birthday? *


*What day are you going on vacation?* 

Students will be placed in groups to ask and answer one of the questions each member will answer. Then, teacher will ask all students to place their strips into the glass bowl found on each table. 

**Development:** 
Teacher will share the learning objective to inform students that they will create short programs that ask and answer questions that require blocks of string and numerical statements (blocks of code). 

Teacher will begin by reviewing the following... 

**Vocabulary Definitions:**
	
○ Java: An object-oriented programming language typically used for Android development. Java is known for being applicable to a multitude of platforms. 

○ Class: The template or blueprint of the methods and variables for a particular category of object. 

○ Methods: Functions within a class that can be reused to	perform specific operations or tasks. 

○ Sting: In Java, strings refer to objects. Strings are a non-primitive data type that represents a sequence of character values. Strings must be surrounded by double quotation marks (“ “). String objects can have associated methods to perform certain operations on the given string. 

○ Initialization: String initialization is one of the basic parts of programming. String initialization means assigning a value to the variable before it’s used in the java program. 

○ Concatenation: is the operation of joining two strings together.  


Teacher will review the the steps to accomplish the learning objective of effectively write a block of code:
(a) “Visual aid,” or (b) “pseudocode,” (c) “write code.” 
To begin the three steps above, select a sentence strip from the bowl. Read it aloud: “When is your best friend’s birthday?” 


**GRADUAL RELEASE OF RESPONSIBILITY:**

“I” Section
 Teacher will think aloud to demonstrate how to apply visual or pseudocode to write a block of code. 
		

 
Teacher thinks aloud:

	//When is your best friend’s birthday? 
		February 7
	//What needs to be initialized?
		The month and date
	//What is an appropriate method name? 
		BestFriendBirthday
	//What needs to be printed?
		The question and answer.
	//What primitive type(s) is needed for this code activity?
      int
 


     import java.io.*;
     import java .util.*;
     public class BestFriendBirthday {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
         String month = "February";
     int date = 7;
     int year = 1978;
 
     System.out.println("My bestfriend’s birthday is ");
     System.out.println(month + " " + date + ", " + year);

      } //end of method 
      }



  

 Compile program. 

**“We” Section**
 Teacher will ask students to “Turn and Talk” to examine the process for writing block code for the question “What is your best friend’s birthday?”. After 3 minutes, class will gather to share findings. Teacher will ask one student to select and read aloud another sentence strip from the bowl: “What day are you going on vacation and where?”

Students will turn and talk in small groups to complete the pseudocode prior to block code:

	

 
**Teacher thinks aloud:**


	//What day are you going on vacation - and where?         July 16.                                                //What needs to be initialized?
		The month and date
	//What is an appropriate method name? 
		Vacation
	//What needs to be printed?
		The question and answer.
	//What primitive type(s) is needed for this code activity?
             int
 

 
     import java.io*;
     import java.util.*;
     public class Vacation {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
     
     String month = "July";
     int date = 16;
     int year = 2021;
 
     System.out.println("I am going on vacation to St. Maarteen on ");
     System.out.println(month + " " + date + ", " + year);
    } //end of method
    }

**Medial Summary:**
Teacher will draw students’ attention to the learning objective to review: Students will be able to identify, interpret, and write a block of Java code.

**“You” Section**
 Teacher will provide students with an opportunity to work in small groups to accomplish a task: Select a sentence strip from the bowl. Write your pseudocode and block java code. Repeat 3-4 times. Compile each program. 

**Summary/Closure:**
Teacher will refocus the whole class to summarize the lesson. Two groups of students will be asked to display and read aloud their block code. Following the sharing, a few thought-provoking questions will be asked: 
Questions to ask: 

How did pseudocode help complete the block code? 
Would you consider pseudocode to start your programs? Why or why not?



**Evaluation**
To assess the students’ ability to interpret and create block java code, teacher will walk around and probe their thinking through questioning. Teacher will use conference notes to record data. 

Teacher will evaluate what the students have learned through teacher observations: verbal responses, student interactions, and their independent response.
